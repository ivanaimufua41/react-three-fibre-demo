				The second one is the aspect ratio. You almost always want to use the width of the element divided by the height, or youll get the same result when you play old movies on a widescreen TV the image looks squished.
				The next two attributes are the near and far clipping plane. What that means, is that objects further away from the camera than the value of far or closer than near wont be rendered.*/
